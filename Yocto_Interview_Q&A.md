# Yocto Project ‚Äì Extended Interview Q&A

---

## üîπ General Basics

**Q: Is Yocto a Linux distribution?**  
A: No. Yocto is not a distribution like Ubuntu; it is a **framework to build your own Linux distribution**.  
It provides tools, metadata, and recipes to create a tailored OS for embedded devices.

**Q: What is the difference between Yocto and OpenEmbedded?**  
- **OpenEmbedded (OE)** ‚Üí the original build system and metadata collection.  
- **Yocto Project** ‚Üí a broader project that uses OpenEmbedded as its core, plus additional tools, documentation, and reference distribution (**Poky**).

**Q: What‚Äôs the difference between a framework and a library?**  
- A **library** is code you call from your app.  
- A **framework** controls the flow and calls your code in predefined ways.  
üëâ Yocto is a framework for building Linux.

## üîπ Components

**Q: Explain Poky, BitBake, Layers, Recipes, Images, SDKs in one sentence each.**  
- **Poky** ‚Üí Reference build system (includes BitBake + metadata).  
- **BitBake** ‚Üí Task executor (like `make`) that parses recipes.  
- **Layers** ‚Üí Modular collections of recipes/configs (e.g., BSPs, apps).  
- **Recipes** ‚Üí `.bb` files with instructions to fetch, build, and package software.  
- **Images** ‚Üí Special recipes defining what goes into the root filesystem.  
- **SDKs** ‚Üí Cross-compilation toolchains for application developers.

**Q: What is a `.bbappend` file?**  
A: A `.bbappend` modifies or extends an existing recipe without editing it directly. Useful for applying patches or changing build options in your custom layer.

**Q: How do you find which layer a recipe belongs to?**  
```bash
bitbake-layers show-recipes | grep <recipe>
````

---

## üîπ Build Flow

**Q: What is `oe-init-build-env` used for?**
A: It sets up the Yocto build environment, creates a `build/` directory, and configures environment variables for BitBake.

**Q: What files do you usually modify before starting a build?**

* `conf/local.conf` ‚Üí build machine, parallelism, extra packages.
* `conf/bblayers.conf` ‚Üí active layers (e.g., meta-raspberrypi, meta-tegra).

**Q: What does `sstate-cache` contain?**
A: Pre-compiled build artifacts. Yocto reuses them to avoid rebuilding from scratch ‚Üí makes subsequent builds much faster.

**Q: How do you test Yocto images without hardware?**
A: Use QEMU:

```bash
runqemu qemux86-64
```

## üîπ Customization & Hands-On

**Q: How do you add a custom package/application into Yocto?**

1. Create a new layer.
2. Write a recipe (`my-app.bb`).
3. Add recipe to `IMAGE_INSTALL` in `local.conf` or a custom image.
4. Rebuild the image.

**Q: How do you create a custom image recipe?**

```bitbake
DESCRIPTION = "Custom Image"
LICENSE = "MIT"
inherit core-image
IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " my-app python3 vim"
```

**Q: How do you make sure your recipe runs at boot?**
A: Add a systemd unit file in your recipe and `inherit systemd`. Then set:

```bitbake
SYSTEMD_AUTO_ENABLE = "enable"
```

**Q: How do you debug a recipe build failure?**

* Inspect logs under `tmp/work/.../recipe/temp/log.do_compile`.
* Use `bitbake -e <recipe>` to see environment variables.
* Use `bitbake -c clean <recipe>` and rebuild.

## üîπ Advanced Topics

**Q: How do you add kernel patches in Yocto?**

* Create `.bbappend` for `linux-yocto`.
* Add:

```bitbake
SRC_URI += "file://patchname.patch"
```

* Rebuild with:

```bash
bitbake virtual/kernel
```

**Q: What is a Device Tree Overlay and why is it useful?**
A: A small `.dts` patch applied on top of the base Device Tree to modify hardware configuration without recompiling the whole kernel.
üëâ Useful for adding peripherals (e.g., sensors, LEDs).

**Q: How do you generate an SDK for developers?**

```bash
bitbake core-image-minimal -c populate_sdk
```

**Q: What is a BSP in Yocto?**
A: A **Board Support Package** is a layer that provides kernel, bootloader, device trees, and drivers for specific hardware (e.g., meta-raspberrypi, meta-tegra).

**Q: How is Yocto different from Buildroot?**

* **Buildroot** ‚Üí simpler, faster, but less modular and not great for long-term reproducibility.
* **Yocto** ‚Üí more complex, but supports modular layers, long-term support, reproducible builds, and widely used in industry.

**Q: How can you reduce Yocto image size?**

* Use `core-image-minimal` as a base.
* Remove unneeded packages from `IMAGE_FEATURES`.
* Strip debug symbols.
* Use BusyBox instead of full GNU utilities.

**Q: How do you handle long-term support with Yocto?**
A: Use Yocto **LTS releases** (e.g., Kirkstone, Scarthgap) which get 4+ years of updates. Pin your build to an LTS branch and apply only necessary backports.

**Q: How do you share build artifacts across a team or CI?**
A: Share `sstate-cache` and `DL_DIR` on a network location (NFS, artifact server) so developers and CI jobs reuse prebuilt components.

**Q: How can you add GPU/AI support (CUDA, TensorRT) on Jetson with Yocto?**
A: By using the **meta-tegra BSP layer** from OE4T, which integrates NVIDIA‚Äôs JetPack (CUDA, TensorRT, multimedia drivers) into Yocto images.
